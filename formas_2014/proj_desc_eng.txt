Sweden has the ambition of leading the way to a sustainable society and the energy agenda is at the forefront of political debate. There is a political consensus on the expansion of renewable energy, promotion of energy efficiency and non expansion of hydropower. Nonetheless, the main political conflict concerns the future of nuclear power. In addition, a restriction of the supply of nuclear power will have significant economic consequences in a country like Sweden with a large element of energy-intensive industries dependent on a stable and affordable supply of electricity. Given the ambitious greenhouse gases(GHGs) emission reduction target, and the challenge of meeting the increasing demand of electricity, Swedish nuclear energy policy and electricity sector needs to be scrutinized further; the economic stakes are high. The proposed research aims at a better understanding the consequences of Sweden's energy and climate policies. The research project we are proposing here intends to analyze the socio-economic costs and effects of restrictions on nuclear power capacity in combination with an expansion of renewable power sources, in Swedish electricity production. A computable general equilibrium (CGE) model will be developed to analyze these issues from a economy-wide perspective. The tool developed in this project will be an important contribution to policy modeling effort for Swedish energy system in general and the economics of possible nuclear phase out in particular.
