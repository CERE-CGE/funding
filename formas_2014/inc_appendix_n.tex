The budget for the project consists mainly of salaries to researchers. A small part is funding
for collaboration, travel and data. In total we seek 3844 TSEK which is distributed as follows:\\*
\indent Örjan Furtenback; salary (100 \% of full time), overhead and premises: 1872 TSEK\\*
\indent Santosh Ram Joshi; salary (100 \% of full time), overhead and premises: 1872 TSEK\\*
\indent Collaboration, travel and data: 100 TSEK\\*
The last item is mainly aimed at traveling expenses for collaborators Christoph Böhringer, Martin Hill and Badri Narayanan Gopalakrishnan. Professor Böhringer will partly be funded internally by CERE during the project.\\*
