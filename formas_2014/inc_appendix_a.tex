\section{Objectives and aim}
This research project looks at the effects of constraints on Swedish nuclear power capacity combined with an increased demand for balancing power, following to expand renewable (weather-dependent) sources such as solar and wind. The aim is to analyze Swedish nuclear power scenarios over the next couple of decades within the context of achieving climate objectives. To this end, an existing Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model will be augmented to include detailed description of the Swedish energy sector. This type of model, called a hybrid model, combines detailed micro data on the energy sector with aggregate data. This type of CGE model is currently missing for Sweden and would be a genuine contribution to the analysis of energy policy in general, but also a particularly well adapted tool for the project we are proposing here.

%Sweden not only puts high priority on sustainable development but also permeates in all policy areas\footnote{http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_ni/ni_pdfs/NationalReports/sweden/Full_text.pdf}
Sweden seeks to be a forerunner in climate policy and governmental reports stress the urgency of curbing anthropogenic atmospheric greenhouse gases (Roadmap for a fossil fuel independent transport system in 2030 \cite{SOU201384} and Sweden - an emissions-neutral country by 2050 \cite{sepa2012}). There is also political consensus on the expansion of renewable energy, promotion of energy efficiency and non expansion of hydropower. Nonetheless, the main political conflict regards the future of nuclear power. The green party wants a quick phase out, while e.g. the liberal party support replacement of existing reactors. A larger variability and increasing demand of electricity is expected \cite{sepa2012, SOU201384}. Given the ambitious GHGs emission reduction target \cite{SOU201384}, and the challenge of meeting the increasing demand of electricity, Swedish nuclear power policy and electricity sector needs to be scrutinized further; the economic stakes are considerable.

Water for hydropower can be stored in reservoirs and production can hence efficiently adjust to changing demand$\/$supply of electricity. Hydropower is especially important in an energy system that includes intermittent sources, such as solar and wind power. Hydropower also has a function as base load\footnote{The minimum amount of electric power delivered or required over a given period at a constant rate.} in the Swedish electricity mix due to its large share of the Swedish electricity production. Nuclear power also provides base load power in Sweden but is not as important as hydropower in terms of balancing short-run electricity demand and supply fluctuation. A reduction in the base load capacity by reducing or decommission nuclear power while at the same time increasing intermittent sources will put a stress on hydropower in terms of both increased base load requirement and increased balancing demand at the same time. This will most certainly have impact on the scale as well as the stability of the Swedish electricity system.

Our main research question is: how will the Swedish economy adapt to major changes of the energy system. Constraining nuclear will most likely have major economic consequences in a country like Sweden with a large element of energy-intensive industries. Secondly, can the emission reduction target be achieved without nuclear power? Furthermore, there are important spillover effects of such policies on the economy.

With the type of CGE model we propose, it will be possible to analyze the effects of policy measures targeted at singular as well as groups of power sources in a system perspective. The tool will be an important contribution to the analysis of Swedish energy policy in general and policies targeting phase out of nuclear power in particular.

\section{Overview of the research area}
Globally, nuclear energy contributes around 14\% for the world electricity generation \citep{OECD2012}. Many countries in Europe depend on nuclear energy for the electricity generation with 75\% in France , 54\% in Slovak Republic , 51\% in Belgium\footnote{http://www.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/NuclearShareofElectricityGeneration.aspx}. About 40\% of total Swedish electricity generation in 2011 was produced from nuclear energy \citep{SEA2012}. However, the future of nuclear power is uncertain in a number of countries due to economic, technological, environmental and political factors \citep{Joskow2012}. On the one hand, nuclear power continues to generate enthusiasm based on its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and comparatively cheaper to renewable energy \citep{Davis2012, Renssen2013}. On the other hand, there is growing opposition against nuclear power regarding its safety, handling and storage of spent fuel, and potential effect on the proliferation of nuclear weapons. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany and Switzerland have decided to phase out the nuclear power completely from their energy portfolio by  2022 and 2034 respectively. The position taken by Germany and Switzerland points to the potential tension between a need for climate mitigation and a desire to remove nuclear power \citep{Glomsrod2013}. It is quite likely that Sweden faces similar challenges in the coming future (whether or not to phase out nuclear power under our emission targets for 2030). Without a well defined capacity replacement plan, the countries could face a severe shortage of electricity supply and hence significant cost to the society.

Several studies have estimated the potential economic consequences of nuclear phase-out \citep{Bohringer2002, Nestle2012, Bretschger2012, Duscha0, Glomsrod2013, Kunsch2014}. The study by \cite{Bretschger2012} for Switzerland showed that the nuclear phase-out can be achieved at moderate costs by investing in innovative industries and through structural change to a less energy dependent economy. Moreover, if electricity trade within European countries are unrestricted the the short or medium term effect on electricity price will be moderate \citep{Glomsrod2013}. \cite{Chen2013} shows that it is crucial to convert the industrial structure into a less energy intensive one if Taiwan wants to achieve non-nuclear and a low carbon economy. Unlike many other studies where it is shown that domestic electricity price to decrease due to extending nuclear plant life or commissioning new nuclear plant in other countries, the study by \citep{Nestle2012} presents evidence that this is unlikely to happen in Germany. A nuclear energy policy study by \cite{Kunsch2014} found that a early nuclear phase out means that Belgium has to rely on foreign suppliers and increased use of non-renewable and CO$_2$ emitting fossil fuels.

Currently, there is no comprehensive model of the Swedish economy that can shed light on the scenarios focussed in this project. There are only few studies (now dated) on these issues in a Swedish context. \cite{Bergman1981} used a general equilibrium model and showed that given that the product and factor markets functions smoothly, Sweden can accommodate quite significant changes in electricity supply conditions without major economic cost. However, adjustment costs (reallocation of labor force, transportation cost, capital losses etc.) are neglected in the model and could imply quite different costs. \cite{Andersson1997} used a partial equilibrium model and showed that phasing out nuclear power while restricting future CO$_2$ emissions to the 1990 level implies a significant increase in electricity prices and a substantial loss in welfare. In the Swedish Energy and Environment Policy (SEEP) model, \cite{nordhaus1997swedish} estimates the cost of nuclear phase out in Sweden (from 2000 to 2010) to 5 percent of 2010 Swedish GDP. This study, is somewhat dated and lacks a detailed description of the Swedish economy and is thus not able to capture the repercussions that occur between different sectors. Our model will be able to portray the cost of a nuclear phase out given our current energy and climate objectives.

\section{Project and organization}
The research group operates within the Centre for Environmental and Resource Economics, CERE. CERE is an interdisciplinary research centre that unites Umeå University (UmU) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). CERE has recently started a group (CGE Group) to specifically analyze the Swedish and European environmental and energy policies with the help of general equilibrium modeling (CGE). The project we propose will build upon augmenting a model (LUGEM08) constructed for specific use in the Long-Term Survey 2008, which has been used for a number of studies of Swedish climate policy. This will be achieved by using a new database, incorporating a detailed energy and electricity system, and developing relevant scenarios that are required to model the implications of a nuclear phase out. This research will add to the academic discourse on the issue of nuclear phase out and ultimately answer pertinent policy questions to give better guidance to decision and policy making.\\

\textbf{Organisation}\\
Researchers of this project have used CGE models extensively in their research area. The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), a multi-regional, multi-sectoral static general equilibrium model, was used to examine and analyse the complex multi-sectoral and multilateral trade negotiations as are contained in the WTO trade policies. Similarly, GEMINI-E3 (General Equilibrium Model of International-National Interactions between Economy, energy and Environment), a recursive dynamic CGE model, is used to do macroeconomic analysis of the impacts and adaptation to climate change. This model was linked with other systems of models (climate, energy and agriculture) to get wider perspective and implications of climate change. This research was part of Framework Programme 7 project ERMITAGE (Enhancing Robustness and Model Integration for The Assessment of Global Environmental Change). In the Swedish setting the CGE-model EMEC (Environmental Medium term Economic model) of the National institute for economic research in Sweden was used to account for forest sequestration in the analysis of the Swedish vision on carbon dioxide emissions for 2050 as well as the 2030 goal for fossil fuel independence. Also a dynamic CGE-model with age-structured forest resource \citep{furtenback2011three} has been constructed by a member of the team.\\

Many prominent researchers are cooperating with CERE comprising an exclusive and important international network. An important aim of CERE is to provide high class research on topics pertaining to energy systems. Of special interest are the effects of climate and energy policy on energy use, which the proposed project aims to study.\\*
The research group consists of:\\*
\textbf{Dr. Örjan Furtenback} (principal investigator), former employee of National Institute for Economic Research (NIER), working with the EMEC model and conducted analysis of the environmental and resource policies on the Swedish economy. As a PhD student, he developed a dynamic CGE-model with age-structured forest resource for analysis of distributional effects of incorporating forest and forest resources in reducing greenhouse gases. Apart from being directly involved with the implementation of the project together with Dr. Joshi, Dr. Furtenback will function as the project manager.\\*
\textbf{Dr. Santosh Ram Joshi}, a PhD from NUI Galway, Ireland, and a Master from Wageningen University. He has previously worked as a modeler at the Economics and Environmental Laboratory in Switzerland. His research at CERE will be integrating a detailed description of the energy sector into the Swedish model.\\
\textbf{National and International collaboration}\\
Our research group will benefit from collaboration from some top scientist within the field of CGE modeling that are already affiliated with CERE. The following persons, with specific expertise and responsibility, will act as collaborating members of the project team:\\*
\textbf{Professor Christoph Böhringer}; a world leading authority on Computable General Equilibrium (CGE modeling), is a research associate at ZEW and chair at the Department of Economic Policy, University of Oldenburg, Germany. Professor Böhringer will assist in model development and issues regarding CGE modeling in an energy framework. Professor Böhringer is an important part of the CERE strategy to develop CGE modeling – particularly within the framework of our general work on energy issues. Professor Böhringer is currently working with us to develop a 57-sector GTAP version of a Sweden CGE model, which is much more aggregated regarding the energy sector. Thus, there is a beneficial cross-fertilization between this project and work already ongoing at CERE.\\*
\textbf{Dr. Martin Hill}, employee at the Ministry of Finance and Adjunct Professor at SLU and CERE, is one of Sweden's most skilled CGE specialists. As a collaborating member of the group Dr. Hill’s expertise on Swedish policy issues will be an important input when designing plausible scenarios for current and coming Swedish policies regarding nuclear and renewable power.\\*
\textbf{Dr. Badri Narayanan} is researcher at the Center for Global Trade Analysis, Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University, USA. Dr. Narayanan holds an extensive knowledge in data issues regarding CGE modeling and will, as a collaborating member, be an tremendous asset in the labor intense work of constructing the SAM.

As mentioned above, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model will be used for the purpose and aim of our research. In such a model, each sector and consumer optimizes their production and consumption decisions at different stages of production and consumption within their resource, technology and budgetary constraints, respectively. These models also ensure the balance of income and expenditure of the economic agents, market clearing conditions (supply equals demand) and zero profit conditions (sum of inputs is equal to output) for each sector (commodity). CGE models' ability to describe the economy-wide effects is an important difference compared to partial equilibrium which only captures part of the economy. A CGE model can capture the repercussions that occur between different sectors and not only the direct impact in the sectors concerned; hence, CGE models captures the overall socio-economic impact in a more complete and comprehensive way. This makes a CGE model appropriate for a nuclear phase out policy analysis as it not only affects the electricity sector, but also will have economy-wide effects. These models are also useful for analyzing changes in sectoral output, prices, endowments and trade as well as changes in welfare as a consequence to policy changes.\\


\begin{comment}
Hydropower and nuclear power are subject to caps on production, at least in the short or medium term. The growth of hydropower is restricted and the restriction of the capacity of nuclear power is the target for the analysis. These types of capacity constraints are well suited to be modeled under the mixed complementarity framework \citep{raey}, which we will use for our proposed project.\\
\end{comment}
\textbf{Implementation}\\
An initial step for the project is to compile a social accounting matrix (SAM), for Sweden, with specific focus on the energy markets. This work involves the collection of data from different sources and processing of these data so that they can consistently describe the Swedish economy. We need sufficient detail to adequately analyze policies targeting the electricity system. The SAM will feed the model with new and complementary data.
% Model enhancement and scenarios
The existing base model will have to be modified in order to incorporate the new detailed data for the Swedish energy system and calibrated to the current economic situation in order to establish a benchmark for comparison with relevant policies. Scenarios of different potential policies decisions will be studied; the model will need further modification in order to accommodate simulations of these scenarios.\\
% Timetable
The most time consuming part of the project will be the compilation of the SAM and model modifications. The compilation of the SAM will be accomplished during the first year. Model modifications will take place during both of the years whereas creation of relevant scenarios for simulations will take place during the second year of the project (see Appendix J for a gantt chart).\\

\section{Scientific delivery}
CERE has a strong international outlook and continues to strengthen its international reputation by accommodating a large number of foreign guest researchers each year and engaging in international research cooperation. Furthermore, CERE organizes two yearly conferences, an internal conference where researchers are able to present their ongoing work and an external international conference, where CERE (and other selected international) researchers can present their work to other international audience of researchers. CERE has a strong commitment to communicating its research results to the scientific world and the general public.

To ensure that its research reaches the scientific community, there is a strong emphasis on publishing research regularly in scientific journals. In order to disseminate information faster, and as a result of the often substantial delays involved in the publication process, CERE publishes a working paper series, accessible freely online, where researchers can share their scientific articles.

The research papers associated with this project will be published in the working paper series, in addition to scientific and policy journals, with a preference for Open Access journals. In order to reach policy makers and the general public, it is proposed to make a concise summary of the results of the project available online. Moreover, the results of the proposed project will be presented to other researchers at regular international seminars, in addition to the ones organized by CERE.

Energy not only plays an important role for the economy but also for environment and the society. Given this complex nature of the energy issues, it will require knowledge from different fields to understand them.
%Energy issues are becoming increasingly important and related considerations increasingly complex.
Surprisingly, linkage between energy, economics and environment is to a large extent a neglected field at Swedish universities, at least at the economics departments.
%CERE has launched a significant effort in this subject field. An important contribution is the development of knowledge in CGE modeling in Sweden with focus on energy issues.
Acknowledging this, CERE has launched substantial effort in developing a CGE model with focus on energy issues in Sweden and aims to make significant contribution in this research field.
Furthermore, the project will give added insights to important relationships between varieties of aspects that are relevant for understanding how to design efficient and effective policies. Finally, this project will also generate interest for wide varieties of stakeholder, and will play crucial role in better decision and policy making for Sweden.

The Swedish Energy Agency granted, within their scope of guest professor program, our application describing how Professor Böhringer interacts with CERE in building competence in the field of CGE modeling in Sweden – particularly within the framework of our general work on energy issues. This is extremely important in our work on CGE-modelling at CERE, but also for the continuous development of the field in Sweden.

The model we will develop during this project will be a transparent CGE model for Sweden that, basically, everyone may use,  not the least agencies and researchers. At the present, there is an established collaboration between the CERE CGE-group and the NIER both in terms of data compilation and model development. NIER currently uses the CGE-model EMEC, but it lacks detailed description of the Swedish energy system; and the result and our collaboration in development of the proposed CGE-model will strengthen NIER's investigative capabilities. Further, during a workshop on CGE-modeling, held in February 2014 by Professor Böhringer, hosted by CERE in Umeå, discussions began about the possibility of developing collaboration between CERE's CGE group and various authorities in Sweden. We established collaboration with Emma Thornberg (Swedish Energy Agency), Linda Hellblom (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency) and Andreas Vigren (The Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute).

The model we will develop in this project will serve as a vehicle for communicating knowledge of CGE-modeling with these stakeholders in general and the specific issues of energy policies in particular.

Details about how cooperation is planned:
The cooperation is divided in two parts; part one deals with theoretical and practical issues regarding general equilibrium modeling. This part is mainly focused on the dissemination of knowledge in the field of CGE-modeling. During the first year we will host two workshops on general equilibrium modeling. The first workshop will provide introduction to applied economic equilibrium models with quantitative simulations to assess the economic impacts of policy reforms. The second will have more focus on hands on skills regarding actual formulation of models of the general economy with focus on energy markets.
Part two of the cooperation is more focused on the problem at hand say nuclear phase out, increase of renewable sources of energy, energy efficiency, and this part is particularly interesting on our part because we will have the opportunity to get information from the different authorities on what essential part of the energy system that is under scrutiny for new policies. This part of the cooperation plan is set up as meetings with the stakeholders. It will also contain pure development issues at the core of the model we aim to develop. In this respect NIER will contribute consideribly because we will have an intricate collaboration on the issue.

We will set up a system were the code base and data are accesible for all participants of the collaborators of the project. This will include resolution on data integrity that might occur due to secrecy of parts of the data that is required for the completion of the model.
