\section{Objectives and aim}
This research project looks at the effects of restrictions on the capacity of the nuclear power combined with an increased demand for balancing power, due to plans of expansion of renewable weather-dependent power sources. The aim is to analyze Swedish nuclear power scenarios over the next couple of decades within the context of achieving climate objectives. To this end, an existing CGE model will be augmented to include detailed description of the Swedish energy sector. This type of model, called a hybrid model, combines detailed micro data on the energy sector with aggregate data. This type of CGE model is currently missing for Sweden and would be a genuine contribution to the analysis of energy policy in general, but also a particularly well adapted tool for the project we are proposing here.

%Sweden not only puts high priority on sustainable development but also permeates in all policy areas\footnote{http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_ni/ni_pdfs/NationalReports/sweden/Full_text.pdf}
With Sweden's objective to influence climate change in a least possible way, governmental reports affirm the urgency of curbing anthropogenic atmospheric greenhouse gases (Roadmap for a fossil fuel independent transport system in 2030 \cite{SOU201384} and Sweden - an emissions-neutral country by 2050 \cite{sepa2012}). On this regards, there is some political consensus on renewable energy, promotion of energy efficiency and hydropower. Nonetheless, the main conflict lies on the future of nuclear power. The green party want's a quick phase out, while e.g. the liberal party support replacement of existing reactors. It is projected that a larger variability and increasing demand of electricity in a future \cite{sepa2012, SOU201384}. With the ambitious GHGs emission reduction target on one hand, and challenge for meeting increasing demand of electricity on the other, Swedish nuclear power policy and electricity sector must be scrutinized further.

Water for hydropower can be stored in reservoirs and production can hence efficiently adjust to the demand for electricity or variation of supply. Hydropower is especially important in an energy system that includes intermittent sources, such as solar and wind power. Hydropower also has a function as base load\footnote{The minimum amount of electric power delivered or required over a given period at a constant rate.} in the Swedish electricity mix due to its large share of the Swedish electricity production. Nuclear power provides base load power in Sweden but is not as important as hydropower in terms of balancing fluctuating electricity demand and supply. A reduction in the base load capacity by reducing or decommission nuclear power while at the same time increasing intermittent sources will put a stress on hydropower in terms of both increased base load requirement and increased balancing demand at the same time. This will most certainly have impact on the scale as well as the stability of the Swedish electricity system. 

An important question is how the Swedish economy will adapt to major changes of the energy system. Constraining nuclear will most likely have major economic consequences in a country like Sweden with a large element of power-intensive industries dependent on stable supply of electricity. Also, can emission reduction target be achieved without nuclear power? Furthermore, there are spillover effects of such restrictions on the wider economy. Such an analysis requires, in principle, detailed knowledge of every market in the country's economy and how these markets interact. A standard economic model to analyze this type of interaction between markets is a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model.

With the type of CGE model we propose, it will be possible to analyze the effects of policy measures targeted at singular as well as groups of power sources in a system perspective. The tool will be an important contribution to the analysis ability of Swedish energy policy in general and policies targeting phase out of nuclear power in particular.

\section{Overview of the research area}
Globally, nuclear energy contribute around 14\% for the world electricity generation \citep{OECD2012}. Many countries in Europe depend on nuclear energy for the electricity generation with 75\% in France , 54\% in Slovak Republic , 51\% in Belgium\footnote{http://www.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/NuclearShareofElectricityGeneration.aspx}. About 40\% of total Swedish electricity generation in 2011 was produced from nuclear energy \citep{SEA2012}. However, the future of nuclear power is considerably uncertain in different countries due to economic, technological, environmental and political factors \citep{Joskow2012}. On the one hand, nuclear power continues to generate enthusiasm based on its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and comparatively cheaper to renewable energy \citep{Davis2012, Renssen2013}. On the other hand, there is growing opposition against nuclear power regarding its safety measures, handling and storage of spent fuel, and proliferation of nuclear weapons. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany and Switzerland have decided to phase out the nuclear power completely from their energy portfolio by  2022 and 2034 respectively. The position taken by Germany and Switzerland points to the potential tension between a need for climate mitigation and a desire for a society free from nuclear power \citep{Glomsrod2013}. It is quite likely that Sweden faces similar challenges in the coming future (whether or not to phase out nuclear power with ambitious emission targets for 2030). Without a well defined capacity replacement plan, the countries could face a severe shortage of electricity supply and hence significant cost to the society.

Several studies have estimated the potential economic consequences of nuclear phase-out \citep{Bohringer2002, Nestle2012, Bretschger2012, Duscha0, Glomsrod2013, Kunsch2014}. The study by \cite{Bretschger2012} for Switzerland showed that the nuclear phase-out can be achieved at moderate costs by investing in innovative industries and through structural change to a less energy dependent economy. Moreover, if electricity trade within European countries are unrestricted the the short or medium term effect on electricity price will be moderate \citep{Glomsrod2013}. \cite{Chen2013} shows that it is crucial to convert industrial structure into a less energy intensive if Taiwan wants to achieve non-nuclear and low carbon environment. Unlike many other studies where it is shown that domestic electricity price to decrease due to extending nuclear plant life or commissioning new nuclear plant in other countries, the study by \citep{Nestle2012} presents the evidence that this is unlikely to happen in Germany. A nuclear energy policy study about Belgium by \cite{Kunsch2014} found that a too early nuclear phase out means that Belgium has to rely on foreign suppliers and increased use of non-renewable and CO$_2$ emitting fossil fuels.

There are only few studies done of this in Swedish context. \cite{Bergman1981} used a general equilibrium model and showed that given that the product and factor markets functions smoothly, Sweden can accommodate quite significant changes in electricity supply conditions without major changes in the main economic indicators. However, adjustment costs (reallocation of labor force, transportation cost, capital losses etc.) which are neglected in the model could give quite different results. The study by \cite{Andersson1997} used a partial equilibrium model and showed that phasing out nuclear power while restricting future CO$_2$ emissions to the 1990 level implies a significant increase in electricity prices and a substantial loss in welfare. In the Swedish Energy and Environment Policy (SEEP) model, \cite{nordhaus1997swedish} estimates the cost of nuclear phase out in Sweden (from 2000 to 2010) to 5 percent of 2010 Swedish GDP. This study, is somewhat dated and lacks a detailed description of the Swedish economy and is thus not able to capture the repercussions that occur between different sectors. Furthermore, it is important to study the current ongoing debate on nuclear phase-out in the Swedish energy and economic context with current energy and climate policy objectives.

\section{Project and organization}
The research group operates within the Centre for Environmental and Resource Economics, CERE. CERE is an interdisciplinary research centre that unites Umeå University (UmU) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). CERE has recently started a group (CGE Group) to specifically analyze the Swedish and European environmental and energy policies with the help of general equilibrium modeling (CGE). CGE models' ability to describe the economy-wide effects is an important difference compared to partial equilibrium. A CGE model can capture the repercussions that occur between different sectors and not only the direct impact in the sectors concerned; CGE models captures the overall socio-economic impact in a more complete and comprehensive way. The project we propose will build upon augmenting a model (LUGEM08) constructed for specific use in the Long-Term Survey 2008, and that has been used for a number of studies of Swedish climate policy. This will be achieved by using a new database, incorporating a detailed energy and electricity system, and developing relevant scenarios that are required to model the implications of a nuclear phase out. This research will add to the academic discourse on the issue of nuclear phase out and ultimately answer pertinent policy questions to give better guidance to decision and policy making.\\

\textbf{Organisation}\\
Researchers of this project have used CGE models extensively in their research area. The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), a multi-regional, multi-sectoral static general equilibrium model, was used to examine and analyse the complex multi-sectoral and multilateral trade negotiations as are contained in the WTO trade policies. Similarly, GEMINI-E3 (General Equilibrium Model of International-National Interactions between Economy, energy and Environment), a recursive dynamic CGE model, is used to do macroeconomic analyse of the impacts and adaptation to climate change. This model was linked with other systems of models (climate, energy and agriculture) to get wider perspective and implications of climate change. This research was part of Framework Programme 7 project ERMITAGE (Enhancing Robustness and Model Integration for The Assessment of Global Environmental Change). In the Swedish setting the CGE-model EMEC (Environmental Medium term Economic model) of the National institute for economic research in Sweden was used to account for forest sequestration in the analysis of the Swedish vision on carbon dioxide emissions for 2050 as well as the 2030 goal for fossil fuel independence. Also a dynamic CGE-model with age-structured forest resource \citep{furtenback2011three} has been constructed by a member of the team.\\

Many prominent researchers are cooperating with CERE comprising an exclusive and important international network. An important aim of CERE is to provide high class research on topics pertaining to energy systems. Of special interest are the effects of climate and energy policy on energy use, which the proposed project aims to study.\\*
The research group consists of:\\*
\textbf{Dr. Örjan Furtenback} (principal investigator), former employee of National Institute for Economic Research (NIER), working with the EMEC model and conducted analysis of the environmental and resource policies on the Swedish economy. As a PhD student, he developed a dynamic CGE-model with age-structured forest resource for analysis of distributional effects of incorporating forest and forest resources in reducing greenhouse gases. Apart from being directly involved with the implementation of the project together with Dr. Joshi, Dr. Furtenback will function as the project manager.\\*
\textbf{Dr. Santosh Ram Joshi}, a PhD from NUI Galway, Ireland, and a Master from Wageningen University. He has previously worked as a modeler at the Economics and Environmental Laboratory in Switzerland. His research at CERE will in general be focused on computable general equilibrium modeling, and especially on integrating a detailed description of the energy sector into the Swedish model.\\
\textbf{National and International collaboration}\\
Our research group will benefit from collaboration from some top scientist within the field of CGE modeling that are already affiliated with CERE. The following persons, with specific expertise and responsibility, will act as collaborating members of the project team:\\*
\textbf{Professor Christoph Böhringer}; a world leading authority on Computable General Equilibrium (CGE modeling), is a research associate at ZEW and chair at the Department of Economic Policy, University of Oldenburg, Germany. Professor Böhringer will assist in model development and issues regarding CGE modeling in an energy framework. Professor Böhringer is an important part of the CERE strategy to develop CGE modeling – particularly within the framework of our general work on energy issues. Professor Böhringer is currently working with us to develop a 57-sector GTAP version of a Sweden CGE model, which is much more aggregated regarding the energy sector. Thus, there is a beneficial cross-fertilization between this project and work already ongoing at CERE.\\*
\textbf{Dr. Martin Hill}, employee at the Ministry of Finance and Adjunct Professor at SLU and CERE, is one of Sweden's most skilled CGE specialists. As a collaborating member of the group Dr. Hill’s expertise on Swedish policy issues will be an important input when designing plausible scenarios for current and coming Swedish policies regarding nuclear and renewable power.\\*
\textbf{Dr. Badri Narayanan} is researcher at the Center for Global Trade Analysis, Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University, USA. Dr. Narayanan holds an extensive knowledge in data issues regarding CGE modeling and will, as a collaborating member, be an tremendous asset in the labor intense work of constructing the SAM.

As mentioned above, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model will be used for the purpose and aim of our research. In such a model, each sector and consumer optimizes their production and consumption decisions at different stages of production and consumption within their resource, technology and budgetary constraints, respectively. These models also ensure the balance of income and expenditure of the economic agents, market clearing conditions (supply equals demand) and zero profit conditions (sum of inputs is equal to output) for each sector (commodity). Moreover, it can simulate effects not just parts of the economy that are of particular interest, but also of the effects on the entire economy. Hence, a CGE model becomes appropriate in this research when a nuclear phase out policy not only affects the electricity sector, but also will have economy-wide effects. These models are also useful for analyzing changes in sectoral output, prices, endowments and trade as well as changes in national efficiency (welfare) consequent to policy changes.\\
\begin{comment}
Hydropower and nuclear power are subject to caps on production, at least in the short or medium term. The growth of hydropower is restricted and the restriction of the capacity of nuclear power is the target for the analysis. These types of capacity constraints are well suited to be modeled under the mixed complementarity framework \citep{raey}, which we will use for our proposed project.\\
\end{comment}
\textbf{Implementation}\\
An initial step for the project is to compile a social accounting matrix (SAM), for Sweden, with specific focus on the energy markets. This work involves the collection of data from different sources and processing of these data so that they can consistently describe the Swedish economy in equilibrium and that the data are of sufficient detail to adequately analyze policies targeting the electricity system. This SAM will feed the model with new and complementary data.
% Model enhancement and scenarios
The existing base model will have to be modified in order to incorporate the new detailed data for the Swedish energy system and calibrated to current economic situation in order to establish a benchmark to compare with relevant policy simulations. Scenarios of different potential policy decisions will be created, and the model will need further modification in order to accommodate simulations of these scenarios.\\
% Timetable
The most time consuming part of the project will be the compilation of the SAM and model modifications. The compilation of the SAM will be accomplished during the first year. Model modifications will take place during both of the years whereas creation of relevant scenarios for simulations will take place during the second year of the project (see Appendix J for a gantt chart).\\

\section{Scientific delivery}
CERE has a strong international outlook and continues to strengthen its international reputation by accommodating a large number of foreign guest researchers each year and engaging in international research cooperation. Furthermore, CERE organizes two yearly conferences, an internal conference where researchers are able to present their ongoing work and an external international conference, where CERE (and other selected international) researchers can present their work to other international audience of researchers. CERE has a strong commitment to communicating its research results to the scientific world and the general public.

To ensure that its research reaches the scientific community, there is a strong emphasis on publishing research regularly in scientific journals. In order to disseminate information faster, and as a result of the often substantial delays involved in the publication process, CERE publishes a working paper series, accessible freely online, where researchers can share their scientific articles.

The research papers associated with this project will be published in the working paper series, in addition to scientific and policy journals, with a preference for Open Access journals. In order to reach policy makers and the general public, it is proposed to make a concise summary of the results of the project available online. Moreover, the results of the proposed project will be presented to other researchers at regular international seminars, in addition to the ones organized by CERE.

Energy issues are becoming increasingly important and related considerations increasingly complex. Surprisingly, energy economics is to a large extent a neglected field at Swedish universities, at least at the economics departments. CERE has launched a significant effort in this subject field. An important contribution is the development of knowledge in CGE modeling in Sweden with focus on energy issues. Furthermore, the project will give added insights to important relationships between varieties of aspects that are relevant for understanding how to design efficient and effective policies. Hence, the research output of the project will be of interest to a wide variety of stakeholders.

The Swedish Energy Agency granted, within their scope of guest professor program, our application describing how Professor Böhringer could interact with CERE in contributing to the construction of competence in the field of CGE modeling in Sweden – particularly within the framework of our general work on energy issues. This is extremely important in our work on CGE-modelling at CERE, but also for the continuous development of the field in Sweden.

The model we will develop during this project will be a transparent CGE model (with focus on energy issues) for Sweden that, basically, everyone could use not least agencies and researchers. At the present, there is an established collaboration between the CERE CGE-group and the NIER both in terms of data compilation and model development. NIER currently uses the CGE-model EMEC that lacks detailed description of the Swedish energy system and the result and our collaboration in development of the proposed CGE-model will strengthen NIER's investigative capabilities. Further, during a workshop on CGE-modeling, held in February by Professor, hosted by CERE in Umeå, discussions began about the possibility of developing collaboration between CERE's CGE group and various authorities in Sweden. We discussed collaboration with Emma Thornberg (Swedish Energy Agency), Linda Hellblom (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency) and Andreas Vigren (The Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute) which were present at the workshop.

The model we will develop in this project will serve as a vehicle for communication knowledge of CGE-modeling with these stakeholders in general and the specific issues of energy policies in particular. During workshops and meetings, within the guest professor program of Professor Böhringer, this communication will take place.
