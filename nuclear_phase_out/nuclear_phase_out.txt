Socio-economic impact assessment of phase out of Swedish nuclear power

The research project we are proposing here intends to analyze the socio-economic costs and effects of any restrictions on the capacity of the base and regulating power in Swedish electricity production. To this end, an existing dynamic CGE model is targeted for enhancement on detailed description of the Swedish energy sector. This type of model, called a hybrid model, is a combination of detailed micro data on the energy sector and more aggregated data usually used in CGE models. This hybrid model describes the energy sector in sufficient detail enabling analysis of changes in the economic conditions of different power sources for electricity generation. This type of CGE model is missing for the Swedish economy and would be a genuine contribution to the analysis of energy policy in general, but a particularly well adapted tool for the project we are proposing here.

Energy issues are becoming increasingly important and related considerations increasingly complex. Surprisingly, energy economy is today a secluded venture at Swedish universities, at least in the economic institutions. CERE has launched a significant investment in the subject field. An important reason is the development of knowledge in CGE modeling in Sweden with focus on developing energy side. Seeing the energy policy developments in a system perspective also seems increasingly important, not least, in view of what has happened in the energy markets today.

Hydropower has the opportunity to be stored in ponds and efficiently adjust production to the demand for electricity or variation of another generation makes it very important in the Swedish energy system. It is especially important in an energy system that is gaining more weather-dependent force, such as solar and wind power. Hydropower also has a function as base load in the Swedish electricity mix due to its large share of the Swedish electricity production mix. Another important component in the Swedish electricity supply is nuclear power. Nuclear power produces base load power in Sweden and is not as important in terms of regulation, but represent a large share of total electricity generation and offsets hydropowers function as base load producer. Time to time, requirement of imminent nuclear phase out emerge, most recently in a motion of the Green Party (Motion 2013/14:N430).

A restriction in the supply of nuclear or hydropower will most likely have major economic consequences in a country like Sweden with a large element of power-intensive industries. Furthermore, it is important to try to ascertain the contagion effects of such restrictions on the wider economy. This requires, in principle, detailed knowledge of every market in the country's economy and how these markets interact. A typical economic model to analyze this type of spread between markets is the so -called general equilibrium model.

CERE has recently started a group (CGE Group) to specifically analyze the Swedish and European environmental and energy policies with the help of so -called general equilibrium modeling (CGE). CGE models' ability to describe the economy-wide effects is an important difference compared with different types of partial models. A CGE model can capture the repercussions that occur between different sectors and not only the direct impact in the sectors concerned. Compared with partial models captured the overall socio-economic impact on a more complete way in CGE models.

Under the project, a so-called social accounting matrix (SAM) for Sweden compiled, with specific focus on the energy markets. This work involves the collection of data from different sources, processing of these data so that they can consistently describe the Swedish economy in equilibrium, and that the data are of sufficient detail to analyze adequately the various policies in the environmental and energy policy. The plan is to use detailed economic and technological data for the various types of production in the energy sector along with more aggregate economic data from the national accounts to provide a consistent data useful for CGE modeling. These data will be of sufficient detail to enable holistic socio-economic analyzes of policies targeted at individual types of production in the energy sector.

With the type of CGE model we propose, it will be possible to analyze the effects of policy measures targeted at individuals as well as groups of power sources in a system perspective. This has never yet been made for the Swedish economy. The tool will be an important contribution to the analysis ability of Swedish energy policy.
