\subsection{Purpose and aims}
The research project we are proposing here intends to analyze the socio-economic costs and effects of any restrictions on the capacity of the base load power combined with an increased demand for balancing power, due to plans of expansion of intermittent sources, in Swedish electricity production. The goals of this project is to analyze different scenarios under which the Swedish nuclear power system might develop over the next couple of decades. To this end, an existing CGE model is targeted for enhancement on detailed description of the Swedish energy sector. This type of model, called a hybrid model, is a combination of detailed micro data on the energy sector and more aggregated data usually used in computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. This hybrid model describes the energy sector in sufficient detail enabling analysis of changes in the economic conditions of different power sources for electricity generation. This type of CGE model is missing for the Swedish economy and would be a genuine contribution to the analysis of energy policy in general, but a particularly well adapted tool for the project we are proposing here.

Energy issues are becoming increasingly important and related considerations increasingly complex. Surprisingly, energy economy is today a secluded venture at Swedish universities, at least in the economic institutions. CERE has launched a significant investment in the subject field. An important reason is the development of knowledge in CGE modeling in Sweden with focus on developing energy side. Seeing the energy policy developments in a system perspective also seems increasingly important, not least, in view of what has happened in the energy markets today.

Hydropower has the opportunity to be stored in ponds and efficiently adjust production to the demand for electricity or variation of another generation makes it very important in the Swedish energy system. It is especially important in an energy system that is gaining more weather-dependent sources, such as solar and wind power. Hydropower also has a function as base load in the Swedish electricity mix due to its large share of the Swedish electricity production mix. Another important component in the Swedish electricity supply is nuclear power. Nuclear power produces base load power in Sweden and is not as important in terms of regulation, but represent a large share of total electricity generation and offsets hydropower's function as base load producer. A reduction in the base load capacity by reducing or decommission the nuclear power while at the same time increasing weather-dependent sources will put a stress on hydropower in terms of both increased base load and increased balancing demand at the same time. This will most certainly have impact on the scale as well as the stability of the Swedish electricity system.

There is some consensus among the leading parliamentary parties on electricity policies regarding securing hydropower, welcome more renewable energy, and opportunities to work with energy efficiency. The great dividing line and the main conflict lies in the perception of nuclear power. The spectra lies between those who want a quick phase out, and those who are willing to replace existing reactors.

An important question in this political setting is to what degree the Swedish economic system will adapt to potential major changes in the electricity production system. A restriction in the supply of nuclear will most likely have major economic consequences in a country like Sweden with a large element of power-intensive industries dependent on stable supply of electricity. Furthermore, it is important to try to ascertain the contagion effects of such restrictions on the wider economy. This requires, in principle, detailed knowledge of every market in the country's economy and how these markets interact. A typical economic model to analyze this type of spread between markets is the so -called general equilibrium model.

CERE has recently started a group (CGE Group) to specifically analyze the Swedish and European environmental and energy policies with the help of so -called general equilibrium modeling (CGE). CGE models' ability to describe the economy-wide effects is an important difference compared with different types of partial models. A CGE model can capture the repercussions that occur between different sectors and not only the direct impact in the sectors concerned. Compared with partial models captured the overall socio-economic impact on a more complete way in CGE models. The model we propose will be built upon a model constructed by Martin Hill for specific use in the Long-Term Survey 2008, but it became something of a workhorse for various investigations within the Treasury Department and has also been used for a number of studies of Swedish climate policy.

An other feature of the Swedish electricity production system is that major parts as hydropower and nuclear power are subject to caps on the production capabilities. The growth of hydropower is restricted to limited increases in the efficiencies of their turbines and the restricted capacity of nuclear power is the target for the analysis. These types of capacity constraints are well suited to be modeled under the mixed complementarity framework \citep{raey} which we will use for our proposed project.

With the type of CGE model we propose, it will be possible to analyze the effects of policy measures targeted at individuals as well as groups of power sources in a system perspective. This has never yet been made for the Swedish economy. The tool will be an important contribution to the analysis ability of Swedish energy policy.

A nuclear phase out of Swedish nuclear power will be a process that evolve over time and should be modeled as such in order to capture the adaption of the Swedish economic system over time. Capital adjustment over time in dynamic CGE model bla,bla,bla...
Cost of disposal of nuclear waste

Time to time, requirement of imminent nuclear phase out emerge, most recently in a motion for the Swedish parliament (Motion 2013/14:N430) which states that nuclear power is redundant and that Sweden is equipped with means to supply all electricity demand from renewable sources. An other motion for the Swedish parliament (Motion 2013/14:N334) concludes that the Swedish nuclear power is heavily subsidized and urges substantial increases in both upper limits of liability cost of nuclear accidents (9000 percent increase) and mentions an increase of the cost per kilowatt producing set aside for funding nuclear waste storage at 350 percent.

Motif for renewable energy/electricity:
global warming - fossil fuel dependency (security of supply) - green jobs
In order to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius, reducing the EU's dependence on imports of fossil fuels and stimulate the growth of new green jobs is a sharp increase in the share of renewable energy in Europe absolutely necessary.


The Swedish nuclear power plants are old and according to current law it is possible to replace them.

Question 3:
Cost of disposal of nuclear waste
I oktober 2011 föreslog SSM en höjning av den avgift kärnkraftsindustrin betalar till Kärnavfallsfonden från cirka 1 öre/kWh producerad kärnkraftsel till cirka 3 öre/kWh. Den 22 december 2011 beslutade regeringen att endast höja avgiften till 2,2 öre/kWh. Under 2013 meddelade Kärnavfallsfonden att det ändå saknas över 30 miljarder kronor för att de avsatta pengarna ska räcka till slutförvaret av det svenska kärnavfallet. Enligt en uträkning som Sveriges Radio Vetenskapsradion låtit göra skulle avgiften behöva femfaldigas till runt 10 öre/kWh för att täcka upp underskottet i Kärnavfallsfonden.

\subsection{Survey of the field}
Globally, nuclear energy contribute around 14\% for the world electricity generation \citep{OECD2012}. While many countries in Europe largely depend on nuclear energy for the electricity generation with 75\% in France , 54\% in Slovak Republic , 51\% in Belgium\footnote{http://www.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/NuclearShareofElectricityGeneration.aspx}. About 40\% of total Swedish electricity generation in 2011 was produced from nuclear energy \citep{SEA2012}. However, the future of nuclear power is considerably uncertain in different countries due to economic, technological and political factors \citep{Joskow2012}. On one hand, nuclear power continues to generate enthusiasm based on its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and comparatively cheaper to renewable energy \citep{Davis2012, Renssen2013}. On the other hand, there is growing opposition against nuclear power regarding its safety measures, handling and storage of spent fuel, proliferation of nuclear weapons. Germany and Switzerland have already decided to phase out the nuclear power completely from their energy portfolio by  2022 and 2034 respectively. The position taken by Germany and Switzerland points to the potential tension between a need for climate mitigation and a desire for a society free from nuclear power \citep{Glomsrod2013}. It is quite likely that Sweden faces similar challenges in coming future whether to phase out nuclear power or not with emission targets for 2030. In this current context, it is important to understand what could be an economic implication of nuclear phase out for Sweden. How this will impact the electricity market and emission in Sweden ? Can Sweden afford to phase out Nuclear power with potential increase in hydropower generation due to climate change?

Several studies have shown the potential economic consequences of nuclear phase-out with different issues \citep{Bohringer2002, Nestle2012, Bretschger2012, Duscha0, Glomsrod2013}. Temporary halt or phasing out of nuclear reactors would entail more electricity generation from the other sources to meet a given demand. Subject to the constraint on capacity, the substitution follows a merit order of marginal costs of generating electricity from different sources \citep{Glomsrod2013}. The study by \cite{Bretschger2012} showed the nuclear phase-out can be achieved at relatively low costs even when the expansion capacities of other technologies are limited. This is achieved by innovation and structural shift to less energy dependent economy. Similarly, there are several studies done in the case of Germany \citep{Bohringer2002, Nestle2012}. The study by \cite{Bohringer2002} found that alternative regulation leading to same phase-out date can have distribution of of phase-out costs across companies changes considerably for the various regulation schemes, revealing an important equity dimension of phase-out policies. The evidence is presented suggesting that extending nuclear plant life spans or the commissioning of new reactors in other countries is unlikely to curb domestic electricity prices \citep{Nestle2012}.

Potential role of hydropower, renewable and carbon capture and sequestration.
Current energy status of Sweden.
Considering the nuclear power to be phase out, and the possibility of substituting it by relatively in expensive technique of fossil fuel power is excluded due to CO2 commitment and hydropower development is restricted due to its capacity, then the price and supply of electricity will most certainly be affected.

The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of different policy scenarios with respect to Swedish energy policy, specifically issues concerning a nuclear phase-out and restrictions on CO2 emissions.
