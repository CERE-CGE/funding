  Abstract                 = {This thesis contains three papers. Paper I: Demand for waste as fuel in the Swedish district heating sector: a production function approach. This paper evaluates inter-fuel substitution in the Swedish district heating industry by analyzing the district heating plants in Sweden in the period 1989 to 2003, specifically those plants incinerating waste. A multi-output plant-specific production function is estimated using panel data methods. A procedure for weighting the elasticities of factor demand to produce a single matrix for the whole industry is introduced. The price of waste is assumed to increase in response to the energy and CO$_2$ tax on waste-to-energy incineration that was introduced in Sweden on 1 July 2006. Analysis of the plants involved in waste incineration indicates that an increase in the net price of waste by 10\% is likely to reduce the demand for waste by 4.2\%, and increase the demand for bio-fuels, fossil fuels, other fuels and electricity by 5.5\%, 6.0\%, 6.0\% and 6.0\%, respectively. Paper II: Towards a dynamic Ecol-Econ CGE model with forest as biomass capital This study presents a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model that combines economic and ecological aspects of forest biomass. A framework is introduced for modeling the growth of a biomass stock which interacts with economic sectors. Harvest of and demand for forest products and forest amenities are determined endogenously in an inter-temporally consistent way. The idea is based on a Markovian growth model of the forest. The study demonstrates an approach for incorporating non-market values of forests, such as carbon sequestration, recreation and biodiversity, into a growth model. A simple simulation illustrates harvest behavior when the economy is subjected to shocks. Paper III: A dynamic CGE-model with heterogeneous forest biomass: Applications to climate policy. This study introduces a framework for modeling a renewable forest biomass stock interacting with economic sectors in },
